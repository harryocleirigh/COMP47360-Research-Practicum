> Use Postman to mimic frontend
    What format are request params/bodies? (metric, date, time)
> What format will requests to ML machine be? (The same as above?)
> Format of response to frontend

> Create Dummy frontend (postman)
> Create Dummy ML Machine (Start with file of dummy responses, then try with a apache server)

What requests will frontend make?
> Event names (get from DB)
> Metric names (get from DB)
> Predictions (date, location/sub-location, event) (get from ML)

sprint 1 backend tasks:
> Investage Web Frameworks (DONE) Node
> Investigate DB options (DONE) Mongo
> Investigate automatic testing options
> Plan for hosting (DONE) (UCD sever, host DB, express app, ml server)

What to do to?
> Investigate ML API options (DONE)
> Get python script served on apache server
> Try running everything on UCD Server
> Validation (models, url params)
> Make sure api is REST format
> Investigate automatic testing options to evaluate website load, security, response times

ML api:
> Machine to host algorithm (FLASK AND APACHE)
> gets http request for prediction and responds with one
> python, model
