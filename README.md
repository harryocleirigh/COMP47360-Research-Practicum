# COMP47360-Research-Practicum

AfterParty is an advanced event impact analysis tool designed to predict the effects of large-scale events on urban areas, with a specific focus on Manhattan during significant events like St. Patrick's Day. This project integrates machine learning algorithms with a detailed, interactive front-end to provide predictive insights into urban mobility and event impacts.

## Project Aim
The aim of AfterParty is to provide city planners, event organizers, and public authorities, and citizens alike, with a tool that helps in understanding and planning for the impact of large-scale events on urban mobility and busyness.

## Technical Stack
- Front-end: React.js, MapBox
- Back-end: Node.js, Flask
- Database: SQLite

## Key Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Utilises a machine learning model to analyze historical data and predict changes in city dynamics during major events.
- **Interactive Data Visualisation**: Implements MapBox for dynamic visualizations, offering users a clear representation of predicted event impacts on Manhattan.
- **Responsive UI**: A user-friendly interface developed with React.js, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Node.js and SQLite are used for robust backend data handling, supporting the processing of large datasets with quick response times.
- **API Integration**: Custom-built RESTful APIs facilitate efficient data retrieval and management, ensuring seamless communication between the front-end and back-end.
